# MM-STROKEnet: A Novel Approach for Stroke Lesion Segmentation Using multi MRI Modalities
This package provides an implementation of the MM-StrokeNet method. This is a new model for stroke lesions segmentation.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and models used for brain stroke segmentation using for our MM-Strokenet using [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet)/[Longiseg4MS](https://gitlab.inria.fr/amasson/longiseg4ms). The model was first trained on T1-weighted MRIs from the [ATLAS v2.0 dataset](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/retro/atlas.html), and then adjusted using a custom [algorithm](./Algorithm/finetune_Script.py) to make it compatible with T1+FLAIR MRIs. It was then further finetuned using T1-weighted+FLAIR MRIs from our own in-house dataset (not publicly available for the moment). The repository also contains the weights and results from [both models](./Models/).

### Installation Steps
Clone this repository with the following command :

```git clone https://github.com/LounesMD/MM_StrokeNet.git```

## MM-StrokeNet packages
In this repository you will find the following folders :
* Algorithm : Our custom algorithm is designed to modify a pretrained model, allowing it to conform to the architecture of a different model, thereby facilitating the transfer of learned features between models.
* Images : All visual assets used in the paper, such as images and figures.
* Models : The weights and models for our pretrained and finetuned networks
