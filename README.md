# nnU_Net-Brain-Segmentation
This repository contains the code and models used for brain stroke segmentation using nnU-Net/Longiseg4MS. The initial model was trained on T1-weighted MRIs, and the code for adapting this model to work on T1+FLAIR MRIs is also included. The repository also contains the weights and results from both models (T1-weighted and T1-weighted+FLAIR).
